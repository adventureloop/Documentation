Generation has been used in games for decades, originally taken advantage
of to allow reduction in the amount of disk space required to store the game.
With modern games generation is used at all levels, from building the world the
user operates within, to allowing dynamic events and quests for the player to
complete. Most modern games involve generation in some form, lack of such now 
will cause games to be called static, unimaginative or on rails.\\

Generated worlds are at the extreme end of the scale, but since the beginning of
the games industry generated worlds have been a valuable technique for developers
and players alike.\\ 

Generated worlds are used in all levels of the game industry, but with it
becomming easier and easier for small indiependant developers to gain a foothold
many games have appeared that use generation as a core gameplay mechanic.\\
